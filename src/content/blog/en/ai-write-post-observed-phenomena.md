> Recently, I've been writing posts announcing new features for Klavis-AI across various social platforms
>
> We prepared a carefully crafted technical blog that everyone agreed on, then asked AI to write platform-specific posts in different styles

After reviewing them, we discovered astonishing quality differences:

- Hacker News: Matched the open-source focused style, but the tone was overly flashy and prone to exaggeration
- LinkedIn: Completely mismatched its "business" style, written purely from an open-source/technical perspective
- Reddit: Felt like reading an actual Reddit post, but even non-native English speakers could tell it was AI-generated
- Twitter/X: Perfect
- V2EX: Hit the mark
- Discord: Perfectly fine from a closed community perspective

## Attempting to Summarize the Reasons

Clearly, how well AI writes depends on how open the social platform is.

So it essentially boils down to:

Open platforms: AI thrives, but so do people - at the cost of declining community quality.

Closed platforms: Limit AI presence, but also limit human participation - leading to community stagnation.
