> Recently, I've been writing feature announcement posts for Klavis-AI across various social platforms
>
> We prepared a carefully crafted technical blog that everyone agreed on, then asked AI to generate platform-specific versions

After reviewing, we discovered striking quality differences:

- Hacker News: Matched the open-source focused style, but with exaggerated, floating tone
- LinkedIn: Completely missed the "business" style, wrote purely from open-source/technical perspective  
- Reddit: Felt like an actual Reddit post, but even non-native speakers could tell it was AI-generated
- Twitter/X: Perfect
- V2EX: Nailed it
- Discord: Worked fine from closed community perspective

## Attempting to Summarize Reasons

Clearly, AI writing quality depends heavily on how open the social platform is.

This leads to:

Open platforms: AI thrives, but so do humans - community quality declines.

Closed platforms: Limits AI presence, but also limits human engagement - community stagnates.
