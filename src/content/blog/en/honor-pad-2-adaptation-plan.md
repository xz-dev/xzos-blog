### [This Plan Has Been Canceled](https://xzos.net/index.php/galaxy/2018/06/30/cancel-plan-honor-pad-2-lineage/)

> Inspired by the excellent experience of Lineage OS on Xiaomi Mi 6,
>
> I conceived the idea of completing the adaptation of Lineage OS for Honor Pad 2 during the summer vacation.

Given that there's already a [recovery package](https://club.huawei.com/thread-11951511-1-1.html) and third-party ROMs (suspected to be genuine) available for this device,

Adapting Lineage OS for it becomes feasible.

The temporary plan is: Adapt Lineage OS for Honor Pad 2 by referencing the official Lineage OS ROM source code of Honor 5x.

Since the tablet isn't with me currently, the adaptation can only begin during the vacation (August).

This will be my first attempt at ROM adaptation. If you're interested in participating (or just having fun together), feel free to contact me 🙂
