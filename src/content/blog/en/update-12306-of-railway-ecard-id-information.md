Search for "BOC Customer Verification" in WeChat mini-programs (this mini-program's sole function), then update ID information using ID card photos.

Through testing, downloading the Bank of China APP cannot update ID information (if you don't have a Class 1 card), and may even upgrade Railway e-Card to Class 2 unnecessarily.
