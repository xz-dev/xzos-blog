People watching over AI at work,  
Closing their eyes, thoughts gradually drift away.

They recall centuries past—  
Farmers watching over rice fields and harvesters,  
Workers tending lathes and robotic arms.

They wait for AI's notification requesting assistance.  
The AI keeps working, but they're only there to supervise its correctness.

Before, tools derived value from human use;  
Now, humans derive value merely from assisting AI.

AI lacks logic, being cleverly designed "parrots";  
Humans possess logic but have been reduced to AI's tools.

> Is this the future of office cubicles?

Once white-collar jobs required human knowledge,  
In the future, white-collar existence means AI needs logically thinking minds.
