[To the Stars, Our Dreams Are Bound](https://twitter.com/CatherinScience/status/1585568959553732608?s=19)

I close my eyes, see no stars,
Lost in dreams of Space and Mars.
Journey begun, with no end,
Message for humanity, we hope to send.

Close your eyes, dream of Space,
Curiosity discovers, warm embrace.
Equations, mathematics, symmetry found
Towards the stars, our dreams are bound
