> Having stayed at school for a semester, I feel like I've accomplished nothing.

All progress seems so sluggish

I dislike this semester's courses, yet these very courses keep me trapped

I think: ~~This school is too terrible, I need to find my own path~~

But when I want to put my ideas into practice, I lose motivation and lack uninterrupted time

Fragmented time is ~~useless~~, yet this damned school only gives me these granular pieces of time

So tired, I miss you, I miss home, I want to do what I truly desire

~~At least I'll be going back soon~~
