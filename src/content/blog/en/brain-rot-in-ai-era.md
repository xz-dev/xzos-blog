> Everyone has wanted your attention since the newspaper era.

In the past, people still needed to invest effort, creating content manually with increasingly professional methods.

But when someone discovered that AI could directly produce and publish content, Pandora's box was opened.

Attention is no longer something to be attracted—it has become something to be plundered.

When nearly all content is AI-generated, scrolling through your phone becomes like searching for gold in a cesspool.

What's even more terrifying is that no one actually cares whether you find gold. Don't worry, you'll quickly forget this question anyway.

Out of boredom, you pick up your phone, scroll a few times, feel bored, put it down—yet the boredom itself remains unresolved. Soon enough, you'll instinctively reach for your phone again because of that boredom.

Endlessly swiping to the next page in the software pipeline is like being an addicted tourist at a slot machine. You think you're happy just because you pulled the lever.

It's fine—at least you're happy now.

And in this world of lever-pulling, attention itself—the ability to focus—has become the first casualty.

This loss of focus creates an even more boring life.

> But life finds a way. I can "force" myself to revisit pre-AI era books, videos, or even play more games.

> Or I could "live in the moment" and experience the "reality" that AI hasn't yet invaded.

> Yes, these solutions are all "inhuman."

> More importantly, every generation solves problems in ways the previous generation couldn't anticipate.

So human civilization will march forward—but you'll remain stuck in the swamp.
