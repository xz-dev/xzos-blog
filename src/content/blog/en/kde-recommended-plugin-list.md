> A compilation of my frequently used applets

## RedShift Control

KDE store link: [https://store.kde.org/p/998916](https://store.kde.org/p/998916)

Arch community repo: [plasma5-applets-redshift-control](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/plasma5-applets-redshift-control/) (recommended)

Description: Companion applet for RedShift in KDE

Why recommended: RedShift relies on geoclue2 which may fail to obtain location due to factors like global proxy settings. This applet can use alternative location services or manual configuration, improving stability.

Handy tool you might need: [Latitude/Longitude format converter](http://www.gzhatu.com/du2dfm.html)

## Simple System Monitor

KDE store link: [https://store.kde.org/p/1173509](https://store.kde.org/p/1173509)

Why recommended: A compact desktop widget with customizable layout for monitoring basic system status (CPU usage, CPU temperature, memory usage, uptime). Helps quickly identify system anomalies while featuring a well-designed clock.

## Network Monitor

Built-in with KDE (lol

Why recommended: Placing it on the panel helps monitor network changes in real-time, potentially alleviating anxiety caused by slow international internet connections (just kidding)
