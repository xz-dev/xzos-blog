## Preparation Materials

- A cat that's been yowling for days and wants to go out to continue yowling
- Your hands
- Gloves (optional)
- Hand sanitizer **(Important)**

## Specific Steps

You only need two hands for these steps. Either hand can be used for neck-holding or operation depending on your preference.

1. Firmly grasp the middle area between the neck and shoulders (you should feel something like a strap - if unsure, feel your own tendons). With your other hand, begin stroking the back and sides.

2. Wait until the cat lies face down or starts alternating foot taps. ==If this doesn't happen within 30 seconds of stroking, skip to step "3"==

3. Keep holding the neck. With your other hand, place your thumb against the tail base while other fingers either grip the tail or support the hips. Press firmly toward the cat's head until you reach maximum depth. ==Note: You should feel your thumb pressing against a tubular structure inside the cat's body==

4. The cat may start growling and resisting. Don't release (but beware of potential biting - gloves recommended). While maintaining pressure, begin rubbing downward (toward the belly) with your thumb for at least 10-20 seconds. ==If step 2 was skipped, limit to about 10 seconds (longer won't help)==

5. The tail area will suddenly become moist. You'll feel wetness on your thumb and may notice a foul or musky odor (similar to litter box smell). Immediately release at this point. ==(If step 2 was skipped, the cat will proceed directly to step 7)==

6. The cat should begin rolling and rubbing against the floor, possibly tucking its tail between legs. ==(If step 2 was skipped, proceed to step 7)==

7. The cat will lick its genital area and stop yowling. Process complete.

8. If step 2 was skipped (cat didn't tap feet or lie down), ==the cat may continue yowling and trying to escape==. Return to step 2 and repeat.

Finally, wash your hands with sanitizer. Pheromones on your hands can prolong the heat cycle.
