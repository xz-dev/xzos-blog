[DP-3T](https://github.com/DP-3T/documents), a privacy-preserving contact tracing software, is like a health code.

The health code, designed from an omniscient perspective to "protect" everyone, almost inevitably leads to Big Brother scenarios.

On the other hand, starting from minimal knowledge and based on P2P (Bluetooth) technology using random IDs and geolocation avoids these issues.

This doesn't align with human intuition as individuals, but the emergence of cryptocurrencies has proven the feasibility of such implementations.

Going further, referencing cryptocurrency concepts like "value networks" and "proof of stake" where actions create value, I believe we can introduce cryptocurrency token rewards to prevent users from resetting their IDs. Additionally, using blockchain-based timestamping and distributing time credits can ensure users keep their phones online (except during unavoidable outages) and maintain a 14-day monitoring period.
